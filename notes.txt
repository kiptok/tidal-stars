the moon changes color (as its 'phases')
the stars twinkle with it
you use the light of the moon to find stars (are you the moon?)
kind of a rhythm game -- need a 'beat'
incorporate scales

art
moon
stars - procedurally generated
playing field - gradient

sounds
twinkling
collection sound

gameplay
the moon phase controls the waves as they reach the shore
the impact shoots something (a surfer? water?) upward to reach the stars

design
bordered playing field
gradient that represents the moon phase
e.g. the playing field is ramped in proportion to the light to dark parts
split in the middle between base colors, then a ramp that wraps across the sides

Star.lua
the star is a collection of points
collectible â€“ always?
they react to the moon & its phases
it also has a unique sound

Moon.lua
the moon is a unique entity that affects the field
it has phases between 2(?) colors, the balance of which creates a gradient on the field that might conceal or reveal the stars

Song.lua
the song is created by the collection of stars
they play in sequence according to the beat
a finished song is played back at the end

Wave.lua
the wave moves as the moon phases
set the speed of the wave and then 'release' it
